## About

I am the Vice Chair of Operations and Boeing-Roundhill Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington, where I also hold an Adjunct Professorship in Human Centered Design & Engineering. My research laboratory specializes in the development, measurement, and control of self-assembly of soft materials at the nano and micrometer scales.

### Education

- **Ph.D.** in Chemical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University (2006)
- **M.S.** in Colloids, Polymers and Surfaces, Carnegie Mellon University (2006)
- **B.S.** in Chemical Engineering, University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez (2001)
- **Postdoctoral Associate**, NIST Center for Neutron Research (2006-2007)

### Research Interests

My current research focuses on:

- **High-throughput materials discovery** using laboratory automation and AI-driven experimentation
- **Functional emulsions** for medical imaging and treatment
- **Electrochemical energy storage materials** for advanced batteries
- **Self-assembly of soft materials** and nanostructures
- **Autonomous experimentation** and open-source laboratory automation

Our work combines experimental techniques including small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS), advanced characterization methods, and computational approaches to understand and engineer materials from the molecular to macroscopic scales.

### Recent Honors and Awards

- **Fellow of the Neutron Scattering Society of America** (2024)
- **Anne Mayes Memorial Award**, Neutron Scattering Society of America (2022)
- **DOE Women in Clean Energy C3E Education Award** (2018)
- **UW College of Engineering Faculty Award for Teaching** (2018)
- **DOE Early Career Award**, Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Sciences (2013)

### Teaching

I teach courses ranging from Heat Transfer and Surface & Colloid Science to the innovative "Kitchen Engineering" course that uses culinary examples to introduce first-year students to engineering concepts.

### Entrepreneurship

I have co-founded multiple startup companies based on technologies developed in my research laboratory:

- **Membrion Inc.** (2015-present) - Nanoporous ceramic membranes for ionic separations and water purification
- **JanuTech** (2025-present) - Nanostructured additives for fast-charging lithium and sodium-ion batteries
- **PolyDrop LLC** (2013-2023) - Conductive polymer additives for coatings and materials

### Service and Leadership

As Vice Chair of Operations (2025-present), I oversee the department's teaching and research infrastructure, support faculty development, and lead efforts in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA). Previously, I served as Interim Chair of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (2021-2023) and Associate Chair for Research and Infrastructure in Chemical Engineering (2018-2021).
