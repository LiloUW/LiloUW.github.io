## Research Lab

The Pozzo Research Laboratory is located in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington. Our work focuses on:

- Development and control of self-assembly in soft materials
- High-throughput materials discovery using AI and laboratory automation
- Advanced characterization with small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering
- Functional nanomaterials for energy storage and medical applications
- Open-source tools for autonomous experimentation

### Facilities

Our laboratory houses state-of-the-art equipment including:
- High-throughput small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) instrumentation
- Laboratory automation platforms (liquid handlers, robotic systems)
- Rheology and materials characterization equipment
- Advanced synthesis capabilities for soft matter and nanomaterials

We also collaborate extensively with national user facilities including:
- NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR)
- Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory
- Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL)
